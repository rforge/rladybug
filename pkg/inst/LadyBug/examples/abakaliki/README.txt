Smallpox epidemic of Abakaliki, Nigeria treated in the article:
O'Neill, P. D. and Roberts, G. O. (1999). Bayesian inference for
partially observed stochastic epidemics. J. R. Statist. Soc. A 162,
121--129.

This example provided to show how the LadyBug 2.0 program can be
tweaked to analyze some classical datasets. However, the manual
specification of inf times is tedious and also sort of biasing the
search coz even valid exposure times are left skewed.

Comparable results (+/- sampling noise) to the O'Neill (1999) article
should be obtained when using the mcmc.sir specification file.
